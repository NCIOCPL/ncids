title: Accessibility - NCI Design System
---

# Accessibility

The National Cancer Institute Design System (NCIDS) is built as an extension
to the US Web Design System (USWDS) for the use on NCI web properties. As such, accessibility is
a core design principle for the NCIDS used at each step of the development and design process.
The NCIDS is subject to the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, amended in
1998 to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible
to people with disabilities. Section 508 incorporates by reference the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines(WCAG) 2.0 Level AA success criteria. The NCIDS and its components are designed to
help websites comply with accessibility requirements.

## Component Accessibility

Keeping accessibility front of mind, components developed for the NCIDS should introduce no
additional accessibility issues into the design system. Developers use a mix of manual and automated
tests for things like keyboard navigation & screen reader interaction. Any issues found are prioritized
and resolved before being added to the NCIDS codebase.
Accessibility guidance is also provided in documentation for each component.
