# Getting Started for Designers

NCIDS is based off the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) and offers a flexible yet coherent visual style you can apply to all NCI sites. Our visual style adheres to USWDS standards and is tailored to provide users cancer related content in a clean and modern aesthetic that meets usability and accessibility requirements while promoting trust.

## Design Libraries and Files

Our design library is in the Figma Community. To download and learn more about our NCDIS Design Kit in Figma, please refer to our [Figma Guide](/get-started/figma-guide).
