# Overview of the Foundations of NCIDS

## Overview of NCIDS Design System Tokens

Anything we see on a website is built from elements of style: color, spacing,
typography, line height, and opacity. The CSS rules associated with these elements
can accept a broad continuum of values â€” in the case of color, there are over
16 million separate colors in the RGB color space. Font size, line height,
spacing, and others can accept a similarly wide range of values.

This degree of choice can slow down design work and make communication between
designer and developer unnecessarily granular. The Design System seeks to maximize
design efficiency and improve communication with design tokens: the discrete
palettes of values from which we base all our visual design.
