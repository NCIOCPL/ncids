# Documenting NCIDS Component Code Examples

NCIDS component pages provide both guidance on when to use a component, but also **how** to use it. A key part of explaining the how is demonstrating how the HTML, or React, will appears and what markup is used to display it. We have created a `Code` component in the documentation site that allows developers to do just that.

## Example of Code Blocks with previews

We support previews for `html` and `jsx` examples. For JSX, this is specifically supporting `@nciocpl/ncids-react` and React core components.

### Html Example

---

#### Markup to Use

````markdown
```html
<div>Hello World</div>
```
````

#### Working Example

```html
<div>Hello World</div>
```

### Html Example with NCIDS-JS initialization

---

HTML examples are converted to React components first then added into the DOM. During development this is done as part of the Gatsby app. For production builds, the HTML will be part of the generated page. The `<NciDsJsInit>` element can be added to your `mdx` pages to add a initialization. The expected contents of the element is the javascript you will use to initialize your JS. Due to the way we needed to implement this, there are some constraints:

1. The code will be executed for **EACH** html `Code` block on the page.
2. The element that wraps the preview will be available to your script as the variable `preview`.
3. The code is run as a listener on the window, and most likely run before DOM content loaded. (So please do not assume anything)
4. The `ncids-js` library is available at `window.ncids`.

#### RECOMMENDATION USE

- Use only one `NciDsJsInit` component per page
- Group all preview block initialization scripts within the single `NciDsJsInit`
- Only initialize the examples contained within the `preview` element
  - For example use `preview.querySelectorAll('.usa-component')` to get all of your components

** Markup to Use **

````markdown
```html
<div>Open the Dev Tools Console</div>
```

<NciDsJsInit>{` console.log('Html Exmaple with NCIDS-JS initialization');`}</NciDsJsInit>
````

> **_NOTE:_** Wrap javascript in template literals `` {` ... `} `` so that the linter does not flag the script as bad React.

** Working Example **

```html
<div>Open the Dev Tools Console</div>
```

<NciDsJsInit>{`
	console.log('Html Exmaple with NCIDS-JS initialization');
`}</NciDsJsInit>

### JSX (React) Example

---

As stated above, we only support React components in the JSX examples. The way that the React examples work is through `react-live`. We have added all the ncids-react components to the scope for your preview, so you do not need any `import` statements in the `Code` blocks.

> **_NOTE:_** Most of the ncids-react examples are fairly complicated and large. So we are demonstrating with a React Button element below.

** Markup to Use **

````markdown
```jsx
<button className="usa-button">Hello World</button>
```
````

** Working Example **

```jsx
<button className="usa-button">Hello World</button>
```

## Example of a Code Blocks WITHOUT a preview

`Code` blocks in any other language will not render a preview. (They will have syntax highlighting though, which is nice) Additionally for `html` and `jsx` we have an additional `nopreview` option to suppress the preview.

### Html without preview

---

** Markup to Use **

````markdown
```html nopreview
<div>Hello World</div>
```
````

** Working Example **

```html
<div>Hello World</div>
```

### JSX without preview

---

** Markup to Use **

````markdown
```jsx nopreview
<button className="usa-button">Hello World</button>
```
````

** Working Example **

```jsx nopreview
<button className="usa-button">Hello World</button>
```

### Other Languages

---

#### Sass

** Markup to use **

````markdown
```sass
.my-style {
	font-weight: bold;
}
```
````

** Working Example **

```sass
.my-style {
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### Javascript

** Markup to use **

````markdown
```js
console.log('hi');
```
````

** Working Example **

```js
console.log('hi');
```
