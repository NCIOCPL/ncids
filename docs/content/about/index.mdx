# About the NCI Design System

The NCI Design System (NCIDS) provides the building blocks to make cohesive, accessible, mobile-friendly websites and applications.

## What is a design system?

A design system is a collection of reusable components and patterns, guided by clear standards for use, that can be assembled to build websites and web applications. Released as design toolkits and code snippets, design systems bring consistency and efficiency to digital properties within an organization. Design systems are always evolving to account for feedback from teams using the systems as well as changes in user experience patterns and best practices.

## Our approach

NCIDS is an adaptation of the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) created for NCI informational websites and applications to enhance their user experience, increase accessibility, and offer opportunities for efficiencies and consistency.

**NCIDS is an important component of NCI's digital strategy.**<br/>
Work driven by NCI’s digital strategy follows these guiding principles:

- Audience-focused
- Data-informed
- Collaborative
- Agile
- Accessible to all

NCIDS embodies these principles and helps to make the digital strategy a reality for teams working to create a unified, audience-focused, and data-informed presence for NCI.

NCI’s design system makes it easier for teams to build accessible and responsive digital products with consistent usability that provides a seamless, user-friendly experience. This is a key requirement of the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA), as outlined in [NCI’s Digital Strategy, available on the myNCI intranet](https://mynci.cancer.gov/topics/nci-digital-strategy).

NCIDS provides standardized design and user interface elements and patterns that follow usability best practices. This speeds up the development process and helps teams focus on creating compelling digital content.

## Design resources

NCIDS provides a Figma community file for our components, templates, and tokens/utilities. [Visit our Figma Guide](/get-started/figma-guide) to download the file and learn how to start designing with the NCIDS. By using the NCIDS Design Kit, you will automatically receive updates we make to our libraries, ensuring your designs stay up to date with the latest releases.

## Accessibility

The NCIDS is built as an extension to the USWDS for the use on NCI web properties. As such, accessibility is a core design principle for the NCIDS, used at each step of the development and design processes.

NCIDS is subject to the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, amended in 1998 to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508 incorporates by reference the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA success criteria. The NCIDS and its components are designed to help websites comply with accessibility requirements.
