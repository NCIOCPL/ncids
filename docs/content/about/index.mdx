# About the NCI Design System

## Mission

The NCI Design System (NCIDS) is an adaptation of the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) created for DOC-owned informational websites and applications to enhance their user experience, increase accessibility, and offer opportunities for efficiencies and consistency.

## Benefits

With the NCIDS, teams can:

- Quickly develop and launch websites and web applications in line with NCI, NIH, HHS and federal policies and guidelines
- Modernize their websites through adherence to modern web/digital standards and best practices
- Leverage user research that optimizes the design and user experience
- Align with the regular practices of modern digital shops and large organizations such as Google Material Design, Apple Human Interface, and Salesforce Lightening

## Design Resources

The NCIDS provides a Figma community file for our components, templates, and tokens/utilities. Visit our Figma community page to download the file and start designing with our NCIDS Design Kit. By using the NCIDS Design Kit, you will automatically receive updates we make to our libraries, ensuring your designs stay up to date with the latest releases.

Also, check out our Figma Guide to learn how to start designing with the NCIDS. Our Figma community file is another step towards making the NCIDS more accessible to the NCI community, creating a space for further collaboration and support.

## Accessibility

The NCIDS is built as an extension to the USWDS for the use on NCI web properties. As such, accessibility is a core design principle for the NCIDS used at each step of the development and design process.

The NCIDS is subject to the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, amended in 1998 to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508 incorporates by reference the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA success criteria. The NCIDS and its components are designed to help websites comply with accessibility requirements.
