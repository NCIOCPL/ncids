# Heading

A customized display and label heading, and H1-H6 styles utilizing USWDS theme tokens.

[View in Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1288512334920909770/ncids-design-kit)

## Usage

- Use heading display if you'd like the heading to be responsive between tablet and large tablet.
- Use the label modifier to introduce a label to your content that has a horizontal line under the section. This horizontal line extends the width of the page.
- Use Heading 1-Heading 6 (H1-H6) style headings to convey the content hierarchy of your page, as well as the semantic function of your text — this will help search engines to interpret the meaning and structure of your content.
  - Note: Ensure that your headings use relevant keywords and accurately describe the content they are introducing.
- Do not skip heading levels. For example, H2 headings should not be followed immediately by an H4 heading — make sure you use an H3 instead of an H4, in this case.
- Do not use text formatting (bold, italics, etc.) in place of headings.

### Where to use

- Use headings on home and landing pages, as well as on inner pages.

### When to use

- Any element can be styled as a heading by using the appropriate heading classes.
- Traditional heading elements (H1-H6) are designed to work best in the body of your content.
  - Use your H1 tag and class for your page title
  - Use your H2 tag and class to introduce major sections, and subsequent headings H3-H6 for subsections.
- When you need a heading to stand out, use a display heading — a larger, slightly more opinionated heading style.
  - Only consider applying the display class to your page title (H1), as this class will make your heading slightly larger than any element styled with an H1 class.

### When to consider something else

- If an element is not styled using a heading class, the [USWDS prose class](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/prose/) can be used to style an element within blocks of text in a WYSIWYG where it’s more difficult to add custom classes to individual elements.

## Best Practices

### Character limits

Character limits are strongly recommended to ensure text is concise, scannable, and not visually distorted.

_Character limits are based on best practices and when a line of text will be forced to wrap onto a second line of text on desktop._

- Keep H1’s between 60-70 characters long. This will help to avoid truncation of your title by search engines.
- Keep subheadings (H2-H6) under 50 characters long to create a content hierarchy that’s easy to scan by users, allowing them to find information quicker within your content.

## Accessibility

**Follow best practices regarding heading usage.**

- **Use only one H1 per page.** The H1 heading is the most important ranking on the page and should be reserved for the page title to describe the page’s overall content.
- **Avoid skipping heading levels.** Skipping heading levels can cause confusion for those using the document outline or headings for in-page navigation. For example, H2 headings should not be followed immediately by an H4 heading.
