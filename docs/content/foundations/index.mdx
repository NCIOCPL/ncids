# Foundations

## Overview

Explore how you can use design tokens and utilities to implement visual elements such as color, typography, layout, and spacing units, on your website.

## What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens provide designers with a way to make consistent design choices with regards to typography, spacing units, color, and other elements of style.

Each token is given a recognizable name and holds a value of specific design elementsâ€” all of which convey the style that will be applied and the intended use of the token. [Learn how USWDS uses Design Tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/).

## What are Utilities?

Utilities are HTML classes used to style a new object or element, or to create an override for an existing style set within the production CSS. Utilities provide developers and designers with ways to experiment with styles without altering the existing styles in the CSS. [Learn how USWDS uses Utilities](https://designsystem.digital.gov/utilities/?).

## [Color](/foundations/color)

Colors set the emotional tone of a user interface and are a powerful way to establish consistency.

## [Appearance](/foundations/appearance)

The appearance of an item can be set using tokens and utilities to manipulate its color, border, outline, shadow, and opacity.

## [Typography](/foundations/typography)

Typography is an important element to ensure consistency and communicate the hierarchy of a page.

## [Spacing Units](/foundations/spacing-units)

Spacing units apply sizing and spacing rules in order to create consistent structures. NCIDS uses USWDS spacing units out of the box from USWDS.
