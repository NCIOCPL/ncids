usage: |
  ### Where to use

  - Links can be used on their own or within text to provide more context for the user journey.

  ### When to use

  - To add a call-to-action or lead users to find more information.

  ### When to consider something else

  - Use a [Button](/components/button) to identify important actions users should take on your website, such as Download, Apply, Learn more, etc.

  ## Best Practices
  - Do not overuse links within text. Using too many links can make it difficult for users to identify their next steps.
  - Be descriptive to explain a link’s purpose, helping users to understand a link’s destination.
  - Encode email and phone links.
  - Clearly identify external links when a link takes a user outside of the website.
    - Note: Do not use an external link indicator when linking to another federal government (.gov) website.

  ### External Links

  - When a link navigates outside of the website or to a non-government website, it must display an external icon after it.
    - Use the global settings to set internal links and bypass default settings, if needed.

  #### Global External Link Settings
  - To display the external link icon the global theme variable must be used: `$theme-set-automatic-external-links-on`.

      **(Default) Display external icon for all usa-links:** `$theme-set-automatic-external-links-on: true !default;`

      **Disable the external link icon:** `$theme-set-automatic-external-links-on: false;`

  - To set specific links (e.g. links to government websites) as internal, the following variable must be used: `$theme-internal-domains`.

      **Default setting:**

      `$theme-internal-domains: (`
       `".gov",`
       `"mailto:",`
       `"javascript:",`
       `"public.govdelivery.com",`
       `"www.gov.uk"`
       `) !default;`

  ## Accessibility
  - Include text within the link that is descriptive and indicates where a link is going.
    - For example, do not only link the words "click here" or "here."
    - Instead use this text to share the title of the page the links goes to or indicate what action the user will take when clicking the link.
  - Allow keyboard navigation of links.
    - Use should be able to navigate between links by using the “Tab” key and activate a link by pressing the “Enter” key.
  - Allow users to activate link hover and focus states when using a mouse and keyboard.

        If the global external link default settings are set using the domain variables provided, an external icon should display appropriately when using the `usa-link` class. However, there are also options to manually force an external link icon to display or to hide the icon, regardless of whether the link is internal or external.

        - **Force the external link icon to display:** Add class `usa-link--external` in addition to `usa-link`.

        - **Hide the external link icon:** Add the data property `data-ncids-internal-link` to the anchor element that has the class `usa-link`.
