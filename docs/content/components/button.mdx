modifications:
  intro: |
    Based on your organizational needs, you might need to modify the button component. The following modifiers are available to change the color or and/or size.

    | Modifier    |                                                                                                                      |
    | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Full width  | Use this modifier to change the width of your button component to be the full width of its container.                |
    | Big size    | Use this modifier to make a bigger button. Use when you need a more prominent call to action (CTA) on your page.     |
    | Small size  | Only use this small button modifier when space is at a premium.                                                      |                                                  |

usage: |
  - It is important to differentiate when a button uses an anchor to drive users to internal and external links, and when the button is completing another action.
    - Anchor link buttons should be used within components to draw attention to the call-to-action. These buttons should not be used within text to direct users to other pages or to different headings within a page.
    - If a button is performing a different action (i.e. submitting a form, opening/closing a dropdown, etc.), an anchor should not be included.
  - Use sentence case for button labels.
  - Write button label text that is short and actionable.
    - Use a verb for the first word of your button text label. Keep the text as short as possible with action words that clearly explain what will happen with the button is selected (e.g., Download, Learn more, or Sign up).
    - To create a more accessible user experience, use the aria-label to describe the desired action or next step in more detail (e.g., “Learn more about...” or “Sign up for...”)
    - When pointing to informational pages, include a succinct version of the page name within the button.
  - To make a CTA stand out, use the big modifier or the most visually distinct color modification.
  - Consider using the icon modifier to add an icon to a button. Use an icon to signal specific actions (Download, Open in a new window, etc).
  ### Where to use
  - Use buttons to identify important actions users should take on your website, such as Download, Sign up or Log out.
    - Avoid using too many buttons on a page— this can cause decision fatigue and confusion, resulting in users not actually clicking on anything.

  ### When to use
  - Use buttons to identify important actions users should take on your website, such as Download, Apply, Learn more, etc.

  ### When to consider something else
  - Use a link styled using .usa-link when linking to internal and external pages within text, or if the action is less popular or less important.
  - Use a link styled using .usa-link when linking users to a location on the same page.

best_practices: |
  ### Character limits
  - **Button text label:** 30 characters (recommended)

accessibility: |
  - **Buttons should display a visible focus state when users tab to them.**
  - **Use standard markup.** Avoid using `<div>` or `<img>` tags to create buttons. Screen readers don't automatically know either is a usable button.
  - **Screen readers handle buttons and links differently.** When styling links to look like buttons, remember that screen readers handle links slightly differently than they do buttons. Pressing the Space key triggers a button, but pressing the Enter key triggers a link.
  - **Use the browser-native disabled attribute for any disabled button.** Don't use usa-button--disabled, which is intended only for debugging and prototyping.
