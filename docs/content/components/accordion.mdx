  intro: |
    Choose from the following types of accordion components based on your page’s content design or organizational needs.
    | Variant |                                                                                       |
    | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Default Accordion | Use the default accordion to add a variant of this component that does not include a border around the accordion panels and only allows for one panel to be open at a time. |
    | Bordered Accordion | Use the bordered accordion to add a border to the panels of your accordion. |

usage: |
  * Use accordion to reduce scrolling time and to shorten the length of pages.
  * On default, the accordion will expand the first section. Ensure that the first step or most important information is located on the first panel of your accordion.
  * Only allowing one panel to be open at a time reduces the scrolling area. However, this behavior might appear to be unpredictable to a user who expects to collapse each panel themselves.

  ### Where to use

  * Use this component on inner pages.

  ### When to use

  * Use for long form content that increases the length of a page.
  * Use to group or sort content in a specific way.

best_practices: |
  ### Character Limits

  Character limits are strongly recommended to ensure text is concise, scannable, and not visually distorted.

  _Character limits are based on best practices and when a line of text will be forced to wrap onto a second line of text on desktop._
  - Accordion heading: 50 characters

accessibility: |
  * **Ensure heading levels are logical.** When using a screen reader and navigating through the accordion panel headings, the heading levels must be the correct level for the page outline.
  * **Keep heading levels consistent.** When using a screen reader and navigating through the accordion panel headings, each accordion panel’s heading level must be the same.

      intro: |
        On default, the accordion will expand the first section. To change the default expanded section, add the attribute `data-open-sections` to the accordion component.

        On multiselect accordions, this attribute may take a list of sections to be expanded at once.
