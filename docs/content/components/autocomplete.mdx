# Autocomplete

The autocomplete is a component that helps users choose answers from a list you provide.
You can also use it to make the answers you get from users more consistent.

## Autocomplete guidance

### When to use the Autocomplete component

- Use when the user should be presented a list of suggestions while inputting a query

### Usability guidance

-

### Accessibility

- Browsers do not manage visibility of elements referenced by aria-activedescendant like they do for elements with focus. When a keyboard event changes the active option in the listbox, the JavaScript scrolls the option referenced by aria-activedescendant into view. Managing aria-activedescendant visibility is essential to accessibility for people who use a browser's zoom feature to increase the size of content.

- #### Listbox
- #### announcement div
