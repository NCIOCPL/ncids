usage: |
  Use the autocomplete component within search opportunities to provide users with suggestions as they type their queries. As a user types, the suggestion bar provides users with related terms based on existing content on your site— preexisting terms aid with spelling and/or concept identification. 

  ### Where to use 
  Use autocomplete functionality when providing users with a search opportunity across your site— this can include a global search functionality for the website or a more regional search experience. 

  ### When to use 
  Use this functionality to minimize users’ time spent when attempting to find specific information, especially when the search opportunity leads to information on wide range of topics. 

  ### When to consider something else 
  - Providing a more specific or defined set of content items. 
    - Alternative: [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) Select](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/select/)

best_practices: |

  ### Character Limits 
  - Character minimum: Three characters must be entered before the Application Programming Interface (API) is called.

accessibility: |
  End result should allow users with keywords and/or screenreaders to easily navigate and discern the suggested terms offered. 

  ### Screenreader compatibility

  As user enters text in the autocomplete input, the screenreader describes the autocomplete functionality as it provides suggestions on the screen— the screenreader will also provide a cue if no suggestions are provided.   

  If a list of suggestions appears, the number of available suggestions is automatically announced via an aria-live region which is updated as results are returned. The results announcement occur in both English and Spanish. 

  ### Aria-Live Region Results Translation Table

  | **English label**                                            | **Spanish label**                                                                              | 
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
  | {Number} suggestions found, use up and down arrows to review | {Number} sugerencias automáticas. Use flecha arriba o flecha abajo para escuchar las opciones. | 

  The list of suggestions has a role of listbox so that the screen reader is informed that it contains a list of selectable items. 

  ### Keyboard navigation 

  | Key                    | Intended Functionality                                                                                                                                                 | 
  | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
  | `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown` | User may use the Arrow Keys to navigate the list instead of using the `Tab` key which would take focus away from the input field.                                      | 
  | `Enter`, `ArrowRight`  | The `Enter` key should close the list and populate the input field with the selected suggestion list item. Focus stays in the input field.                             | 
  | `Esc`                  | If none of the suggestions suit then keyboard users can press `Esc` to close the list without changing the content of the input field. Focus stays in the input field. |

        // Import component
        import { NCIAutocomplete } from '@nciocpl/ncids-js';

        // Set up Autocomplete Adapator
        const MockACSource = new MockAutocompleteAdaptor();

        const autocomplete = NCIAutocomplete.create(acInput, {
          autocompleteSource: MockACSource,

          minCharCount: 3,
          listboxClasses: 'listboxWidth',
        });

    - intro: |
        Creation of the aria-live region, listbox and other aria attributed are taken care of in the initialization of the nci-autocomplete. A wrapper is placed around the specified input and its siblings and the necessary divs are added to the DOM.

        // BEFORE Initialization: Consider the following example text input before 
        initialization as an nci-autocomplete combobox

          <label class="usa-sr-only" for="nci-header-search__field">
            Search
          </label>
          <input class="usa-input" id="nci-header-search__field" type="search" name="search" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>

        // AFTER Initialization
        <form class="nci-header-search" role="search">
          <div class="nci-autocomplete">
            <div class="nci-autocomplete__status" aria-live="assertive"></div>
