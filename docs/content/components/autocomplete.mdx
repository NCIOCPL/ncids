# Autocomplete

An enhanced form input control providing users search suggestions, in real time, as they type.

## Autocomplete guidance

Use an autocomplete control to show suggestions that match what the user types as they type. Users can select a suggestion to
complete their entry quickly and accurately or keep typing to further refine the suggested options. This will help the user to
find related terms or help in cases such as spelling or concept identification.

### Accessibility

It is important to keep accessibility in mind when creating an autosuggest. The end result should allow keyboard and screenreader users to easily navigate and discern the suggestions offered.

#### Screenreader compatibility

As the user enters text in the autocomplete input the screenreader is given cues regarding what is happening on the screen.

If the list of suggestions appears, the number of available suggestions is automatically announced via and aria-live region which is updated as results are returned. The results announcement occurs in both English and Spanish.

**_Aria-Live Region Results Translation Table_**

| **English label**                                            | **Spanish label**                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {Number} suggestions found, use up and down arrows to review | {Number} sugerencias autom√°ticas. Use flecha arriba o flecha abajo para escuchar las opciones. |

The list of suggestions has a role of listbox so that the screen reader is informed that it contains a list of selectable items.

#### Keyboard navigation

| Key                    | Intended Functionality                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown` | User may use the Arrow Keys to navigate the list instead of using the `Tab` key which would take focus away from the input field.                                      |
| `Enter`, `ArrowRight`  | The `Enter` key should close the list and populate the input field with the selected suggestion list item. Focus stays in the input field.                             |
| `Esc`                  | If none of the suggestions suit then keyboard users can press `Esc` to close the list without changing the content of the input field. Focus stays in the input field. |

### Usage

```javascript nopreview
// Import component
import { NCIAutocomplete } from '@nciocpl/ncids-js';

// Get HTMLInputElement
const acInput = document.getElementById('myInput');

// Set up Autocomplete Adapator
const MockACSource = new MockAutocompleteAdaptor();

// Create component with optional options
const autocomplete = NCIAutocomplete.create(acInput, {
	autocompleteSource: MockACSource,
	maxOptionsCount: 10,
	minCharCount: 3,
	listboxClasses: 'listboxWidth',
});
```

Creation of the aria-live region, listbox and other aria attributed are taken care of in the initialization of the
nci-autocomplete. A wrapper is placed around the specified input and its siblings and the necessary divs are added to the DOM.

```javascript nopreview
// BEFORE Initialization: Consider the following example text input before initialization as an nci-autocomplete combobox
<form class="nci-header-search" role="search">
  <label class="usa-sr-only" for="nci-header-search__field">
    Search
  </label>
  <input class="usa-input" id="nci-header-search__field" type="search" name="search" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

// AFTER Initialization
<form class="nci-header-search" role="search">
  <div class="nci-autocomplete">
    <div class="nci-autocomplete__status" aria-live="assertive"></div>
    <label class="usa-sr-only" for="nci-header-search__field">
      Search
    </label>
    <input class="usa-input" id="nci-header-search__field" type="search" name="search" role="combobox" aria-autocomplete="list" aria-owns="nci-header-search__field-terms" aria-activedescendant="">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    <div id="nci-header-search__field-termswrapper" class="nci-autocomplete__listbox">
      <div id="nci-header-search__field-terms" tabindex="-1" role="listbox"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</form>
```
