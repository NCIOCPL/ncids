variations:
  intro: |
    Choose from the following types of promo block components based on your page’s content design or organizational needs.

    | Variant | Description |
    | ------- | ----------- |
    | Promo block component [Default] | The default promo block is a light promo block without an image. <br />If an image is unavailable, the promo block component variant without an image may be used. |
    | Promo block with image | Use this variant to add an image to your promo block. Featuring an image is recommend in order to entice users to click on your content and to provide future context for your user. |

modifications:
  intro: |
    Based on your page’s content design or organizational needs, you might need to modify the promo block further. The following modifiers are available to change the theme of your promo block or to change the placement of your image.

    | Modifier | Description |
    | -------- | ----------- |
    | Theme Modifier | <ul><li>Use this modifier to change your promo block theme from “light” to “dark”.</li><li>Select a light theme when using lighter images and a darker theme when using darker images.</li></ul> |
    | Alternating Image Modifier [Only possible with promo block with image variant] | <ul><li>Use this modifier to change the position of your image from display on the left side of the component to the right side of the component.</li><li>Using a promo block with an image to the left is recommended. When adding more than one promo block, it is recommended that you add them with alternating images — one with the image set to the left and the consecutive block with the image set to the right.</li></ul> |

usage: |
  - Use title to provide a shortened version of the page title or initiative.
    - If used for promotional purposes, title should have an action-oriented CTA to entice users.
  - Use image to entice users to click on promotional content and to provide context for content that will be covered on the page.
    - When using two or more promo block components, add components with alternating images. Do not add other components in between this type of component; doing so can interrupt the flow of the page causing the user to stop scrolling through the page
  - Use description to provide a concise description for the page or initiative.
  - Use CTA button to lead users to more information. CTAs can link to either internal or external pages.
  - Use action-driven button labels to entice users to click on promotional content

  ### Where to use
  - Can be placed anywhere on your home page and landing pages.

  ### When to use
  - Use **promo block with an image** within the body of your page to promote an important initiative or content item that needs to be displayed prominently.
  - Use **promo block** within the body of your page to promote an important initiative or content item that does not (and will not) have a related image.
    - Note: Text should be impactful and striking, as there is no supporting visual, while remaining concise and scannable.
  - Depending on the theme of your web page, the **promo block with an image** or **promo block** can be set to have either a dark or light theme, which changes the background color of the block.

  ### When to consider something else
  - Sharing CTAs that do not need to take up much space within your page or are better displayed with other related CTAs.
    - Alternative: **[Card](./card)**, using the **[3 Card row pattern](../templates/3-card-row)**
    - Alternative: **[Guide Card with Image & Description](./guide-card)** or **[Guide Card without Image & Description](./guide-card)** (to provide users with sets of related CTAs)
  - Showcasing one primary CTA that should be more prominently displayed than all other information on the page.
    - Alternative: **[Hero with CTA Button](./hero)**
  - Showcasing CTAs that should be more prominently displayed at the top of the page and in a set of three. Only use this option if CTAs do not require a description to be understood by the user or the CTA does not demand more space in the body of the page from a marketing perspective.
    - Alternative: **[Hero with CTA Button + CTA Strip](./hero)** or **[Hero with tagline only + CTA Strip](./hero)**

best_practices: |
  ### Character limits

  Character limits are strongly recommended to ensure text is concise, scannable, and not visually distorted. Character limits are based on best practices and when a line of text will be forced to wrap onto a second line of text on desktop.

  - Title: 47 characters
  - Card description: 150 characters
  - Button label text: 20 characters

  ### Image guidance and specs

  **NCIDS Promo Block 1:1 Image Style**

  - Name - NCIDS Promo Block 1:1
  - Scale Width - 890px

  **NCIDS Promo Block 16:9 Image Style**

  - Name - NCIDS Promo Block 16:9
  - Scale Width - 1280px

accessibility: |
  - Ensure buttons have accessible names. Buttons within the promo block should have descriptive text that can be announced in assistive technologies such as screen readers. Modify the button aria-label or use screen reader visible text to augment vague call-to-action text such as “Learn More”.
