overview:
  whitebg: false
  imgsrc: banner.png
  imgalt: Example of a box with an American flag icon and text on the left side, and a language toggle button on the right side.
  elements:
    - description: Banner background
    - description: Text
    - description: Button (Optional)

usage: |
  * Use the provided text without customization. The banner is most effective as an identifier when its message is consistent across government websites.
    * With only a few exceptions (see Implementation guidance), sites should use the TLD-appropriate text provided, unaltered.
    * Use the Spanish version of the banner for Spanish-language websites.
  * Use background colors that fit with the website’s theme. Avoid color combinations that draw excessive attention to the banner.
  * Use the most current version of the banner. Keep the text up to date.
  * If website provides site-wide translation, use translation button  with the NCI small button variant styling— only one button may be added.

  ### Where to use

  * Must be used across the top of every page of a website. Adding the banner to select websites can be confusing and/or misleading to users.

  ### When to use

  * Must be used by all NCI Division and Center websites to designate the website as an official U.S. government organizational website. Do not use a banner that is not provided by NCI.

accessibility: |
  * Use Aria-Labels to provide users with an accessible name for an element. If there is no visible name for the element, use aria-label to provide the user with a recognizable accessible name.

  * NCIDS default markup uses aria-label="official government website" to distinguish the banner header from the main header.

  * Use the banner directly following the skipnav component.
