  A banner identifies official websites of government organizations in the United States. It allows users to know if a website is both official and secure. This component is required for all NCI informational websites and applications.

  imgalt: Example of a box with an American flag icon and text on the left side, and a language toggle button on the right side.
  elements:
    - description: Banner background
    - description: Text
    - description: Button (optional)

usage: |
  * Use the provided text without customization. The banner is most effective as an identifier when its message is consistent across government websites.
    * With only a few exceptions, sites should use the top-level-domain-appropriate text provided, unaltered.
    * Use the Spanish version of the banner for Spanish-language websites.
  * Use background colors that fit with the website’s theme. Avoid color combinations that draw excessive attention to the banner.
  * Use the most current version of the banner. Keep the text up to date.
  * If website provides site-wide translation, use translation button with the NCI small button variant styling—only one button may be added.

  ### Where to Use

  * Must be used across the top of every page of a website. Adding the banner to select web pages can be confusing or misleading to users.

  ### When to Use

  * Must be used by all NCI division and center websites to designate the website as an official U.S. government organizational website. Do not use a banner that is not provided by NCI.

accessibility: |
  * Use aria-labels to provide users with an accessible name for an element. If there is no visible name for the element, use aria-label to provide the user with a recognizable accessible name.

  * NCIDS default markup uses aria-label="official government website" to distinguish the banner header from the main header.

  * Use the banner directly following the skipnav component.
