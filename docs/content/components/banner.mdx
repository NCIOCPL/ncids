# Banner

The banner identifies official websites of government organizations in the United States. It also helps visitors understand how to tell that a website is both official and secure.

## Banner guidance

### When to use the banner component

- Every DOC site needs to include this banner
- If there is a translation, include with language toggle styling
- **Do** use only one button translation with the NCI small button variant styling
- **Do** use the banner NCI provides
- **Don't** use a banner that isn't provided by NCI

### Usability guidance

- **Use the provided text without customization.** The banner is most effective as an identifier and a learning tool when its message is consistent across government websites. With only a few exceptions (see Implementation guidance), sites should use the TLD-appropriate text provided, unaltered. Use the Spanish version of the banner for Spanish-language websites.
- **Show the banner on every page.** Use the banner at the top of every page of a site. It can be confusing or misleading if it appears on some pages and not others.
- **Avoid distraction.** The banner appears on every page of your site. Choose background colors that fit with your site theme and avoid color combinations that draw excessive attention to the banner.
- **Keep the text up-to-date.** Use the most current version of the banner.

### Accessibility

- **Aria-Lables provide an accessible name for an element.** If there is no visible name for the element you can reference, use aria-label to provide the user with a recognizable accessible name.
- Our **default markup** uses aria-label="official government website" to distinguish the banner header from the main header.
- The banner should **directly follow **the `skipnav` component.

**_Aria-Label Translations Table_**

| **English label**             | **Spanish label**                                     |
