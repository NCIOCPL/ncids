# Icons

Icons help communicate meaning, actions, status, or feedback.

## Guidance

### When to use the icon components
Icons are cool.  Don't mess them up.
To draw attention to actions. Icons are helpful when combined with text to inform users about performing an action. The icon should directly relate to the text it accompanies.
To help readers find key information. Use icons as scannable, easy-to-understand visual indicators for key information like a phone number or email address.
To enhance an actionable target. Icons make great touch or click targets. Use an icon for common actions like opening a menu or sharing an article.

### When to consider something else

Meaning is ambiguous. Use icons in a common or conventional way only. If the meaning of an icon is ambiguous by itself, it needs accompanying text.
Compensating for page structure. Icons don’t fix unclear page hierarchy or confusing content organization. Don’t rely on an icon to help draw attention to something important that’s hard to find. Fix the content’s placement first.
You need illustrative artwork. Icons have a specific, functional meaning. Avoid using icons outside their intended usage for illustrative purposes (like using the “visibility” eye icon to illustrate an actual eye). If you want to use a graphic to enhance your content or explain a more in-depth concept, consider using an illustration instead of an icon.

### Usability guidance

Combine with text. Users will not always understand the meaning of icons alone. Use icons combined with text to improve usability.
Be consistent with icon meaning. Icons that are used a number of times throughout an application or site must have a consistent meaning and text description throughout. For example, if an icon of a blank piece of paper means “new document” on most screens, the same icon shouldn’t be used elsewhere to mean “reformat document.” Consistency aids users with cognitive disabilities and creates a better user experience for all users.
When interactive, combine with other components. If the icon is part of an interactive element, it should be implemented within another functional component, like as part of a button or list.

### Accessibility

Hide decorative icons from screen readers. Use the aria-hidden="true" and role="img" if the icon is redundant and used solely as visual progressive enhancement.

<Tabs label="code">

<TabItem displayText="HTML" id="example-icon">

<Code className="html" nopreview>
	{`
<a href="https://twitter.com/uswds">
  <svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img">
    <use xlink:href="/assets/img/sprite.svg#arrow_forward"></use>
  </svg>
  USWDS' Twitter account
</a>
`}
</Code>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Provide descriptive text if a standalone icon has semantic meaning. If you need to expose an icon to screen readers, remove the aria-hidden="true" attribute and add a aria-labelledby attribute with a value that matches the id of a `<title />` element added inside the svg.

<Tabs label="code">

<TabItem displayText="HTML" id="example-icon-accessible">

<Code className="html" nopreview>
	{`
<a href="https://twitter.com/uswds">
  <svg aria-labelledby="twitter-title" role="img">
    <title id="twitter-title">USWDS' Twitter account</title>
    <use xlink:href="/path/to/sprite.svg#twitter"></use>
  </svg>
</a>
`}
</Code>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Place icons inside links. If icons accompany a text link, place the icon inside the link to prevent the screen reader from announcing the link twice.
