  elements:
    - description: Title
    - description: Body Text

usage: |
  - Use summary box title to describe the key information or next steps presented within the body text.
  - Use body text to provide a summary of the page, to display key information covered in the text, or to call out next steps for your user in the form of links or CTAs.

  ### Where to use
    Use component on landing and inner pages.

  ### When to use
    Use **summary box** component at the top of page to communicate important next steps or information at the forefront of your content.

  ### When to consider something else
    - Driving users to a specific page that could use an image to provide further context.
      - Alternative: [Card](./card)
    - Showcasing jump links to the main sections, or H2 headings, covered on your page.
      - Alternative: Internal page navigation or an On This Page section

best_practices: |
  ### Character Limits
  Character limits are strongly recommended to ensure text is concise, scannable, and not visually distorted.

  Character limits are based on best practices and when a line of text will be forced to wrap onto a second line of text on desktop.

  - Title: 20 characters
  - Body text: 250 characters, aim to keep text and CTAs short and descriptive

patterns: |
  ### Summary Box Row
  - If aiming to provide two different sets of information, next steps or CTAs within your summary box, consider using two summary boxes in a row pattern. Learn more about this pattern on the [Summary Box Row Page](/templates/summary-box-row).
