usage: |
  - Use image to provide context for content that will be covered on the page.
  - Use card title to provide a shortened version of the page title.
  - Use description to provide a concise description for the page.
  - (If using within a 3-Card Row Pattern) If assembling three cards within a card row pattern, use a heading to group content within these cards using a common theme.

  ### Where to use

  - Use component on home, landing, and inner pages.

  ### When to use

  - Use **Card** within the body of your page to showcase multiple content items such as articles, blogs, news, or events.

  ### When to consider something else

  - Showcasing call-to-actions (CTAs) for major initiatives or content marketing items that should be described further through an image and description.
    - Alternative: [Promo Block](./promo-block)
  - Showcasing one primary CTA that should be more prominently displayed than all other information on the page.
    - Alternative: [Hero with CTA Button](./hero)

  Character limits are based on best practices and when a line of text will be forced to wrap onto a second line of text on desktop.

  - Title: 20 characters
  - Card description: 75 characters
  - [If using within a 3-Card Row Pattern] Card row heading: 40 characters

patterns: |
  **3-Card Row:** If used on a home page and/or landing page, consider using cards in rows of three to maintain the visual consistency of the site. Learn more about this pattern on the [3-Card Row pattern page](/templates/3-card-row).

accessibility: |
  - **Aria-Labels provide an accessible name for an element.** If there is no visible name for the element, use aria-label to provide the user with a recognizable accessible name.

  - The aria-label of this component is related to the anchor element of the card (the aria-label is on the anchor tag)
