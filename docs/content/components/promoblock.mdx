title: Promoblock Component - NCI Design System
---

# Promo Block with Image / Alternating Promo Block with Image

- Promoblock highlights one specific piece of content.

## When to use Alternating Promo Block with Image

- Used for promotional content to highlight a single subject with left-anchored or right-anchored visual
- Used when highlighting promotional content with multiple Promoblocks
- Used when promoblock is expected to span the width of the page's content (inside usa-section -> grid-container)

## When to consider something else

- If multiple links are needed, look at guide card component variations
- If the promotion isn't expected to be the width of the content

### Additional considerations

- Image on the left should always be the first card unless there is an alternating guide card above
  <br />

# Promo Block w/o Image (Default Promoblock)

## When to use Promo Block w/o Image

- Used for promotional content to highlight a single subject without a visual image

## When to consider another variant

- If a visual image is needed to accompany promotional content, use the Alternating Promo block variation

### Component(s) Variations

- Light text box variation is meant for darker images or illustrations
- Dark text box variation is meant for lighter images or illustrations

#### Dev Notes:

- NCI Promoblock should always be within: `<section class="usa-section" label="Promoblock With Image Right">`
- Wrap the Promoblock component in a grid-container, specifically: `<div class="tablet-lg:grid-container-widescreen">`
- Code Examples Provided Below
