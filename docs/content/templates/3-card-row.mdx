## Overview

![Example of a three card row.](./images/card-row_pattern.jpg)

It is recommended that a 3-card row be composed of three ‘Cards’. Refer to [Card](/components/card) for specific attributes of the card component.

## Usage

- Use heading to introduce content within the cards and to provide context for the association between cards in the 3-card row.

### Where to use

- Use this component patten on home and landing pages.
  - Using one or two card components on a home or landing page is not recommended to maintain the visual consistency of the site.

### When to use

- Use three cards in a row on your home or landing pages to showcase multiple content items such as articles, blogs, news, or events— while also highlighting the association between these content items.
- Refer to the card component page for alternative component guidance.

## Best Practices

Refer to [Card](/components/card) for best practice recommendations specific to the card.

### Character limits

Character limits are strongly recommended to ensure text is concise, scannable, and not visually distorted.

_Character limits are based on best practices and when a line of text will be forced to wrap onto a second line of text on desktop._

- 3-card row heading: 40 characters

## Accessibility

- **Use unordered lists and list items.** Use a `<ul>` for a card group and an `<li>` for each card. This formatting allows screen readers to enumerate the items in the card group and allows shortcuts between list items.
- **Use the appropriate heading level for your page.** Update heading level based on the content of your page to make sure card headings are in the correct, logical outline order.
- **Use CSS to order the media element.** Logically, the media element should follow the header element. Don’t re-organize the markup to reverse their order.
