# Feature Card Row (3 Cards)

The feature card row displays our custom Card component in a grid row of 3 cards in which the cards height is equal across the row.

## Feature Card Row guidance

### When to use the feature card row

- When displaying a row of 3 NCI cards that are links
- When each content item has a title, image, and description, as well as a destination link

### Usability Guidance / Content Required

- Title and Description
- 4:3 image on Widescreen, Desktop (1400 and less)
- 1:1 image on Tablet Large (880 and less)
- 16:9 image on Tablet (640 and less)
- No image on Mobile Large & Mobile (480 and less)
- Title/Description length between cards should be of _similar_ length. A card whose text is too long will behave oddly at certain screensizes that are between breakpoints.
- The cards' height is based on the tallest card, so a long card may make a short card look empty.

### Accessibility

- **Aria-Labels provide an accessible name for an element.** If there is no visible name for the element you can reference, use aria-label to provide the user with a recognizable accessible name.
- The aria-label of this component is related to the anchor element of the card (the aria-label is on the anchor tag)
