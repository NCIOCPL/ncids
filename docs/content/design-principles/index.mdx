# Design Principles

These are our guiding principles to NCIDS that reflect our design philosophy. We are committed to helping those who use our design system successfully adopt it, in order to keep the user experience of NCI consistent and seamless.

## Accessibility <Icon glyph="accessibility_new" style="vertical-align: middle" />

Uses inclusive and representative visuals that engage all users.

## User Research <Icon glyph="chat" style="vertical-align: middle" />

Builds empathy with users by testing often and gathering feedback.

## Reusable Code <Icon glyph="code" style="vertical-align: middle" />

Simplifies development. Code is friendly, easy to use and accessible.

## Governance <Icon glyph="people" style="vertical-align: middle" />
