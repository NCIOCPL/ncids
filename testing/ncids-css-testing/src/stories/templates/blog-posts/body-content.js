<h2 class="nci-heading-h2">To begin, can you explain what you mean by stigma?</h2>
<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Banerjee:</strong> A classic definition of stigma is a mark of
	disgrace that sets individuals apart from others. In our research, we define stigma as a negative
	appraisal by others that can be attributed to a lung cancer diagnosis and internalized by the
	individual with lung cancer.
</p>

<h2 class="nci-heading-h2">How commonly do people with lung cancer experience stigma?</h2>
<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Ostroff:</strong> In surveys, nearly all people with lung cancer
	say they have experienced stigma from doctors or acquaintances. And almost half of those with lung
	cancer say they have experienced stigma during visits with providers, including during routine
	smoking history assessments.
</p>

<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Banerjee:</strong> During these conversations, a patient may already
	be feeling guilty for engaging in a certain behavior and putting their family through the experience of
	caring for a loved one with cancer. Health care providers sometimes amplify a patient's feelings of shame
	and guilt through comments that are made without any intention of harming the patient, such as
	“You smoked for 20 years! What were you expecting?” or “You brought this on yourself.” Even facial
	expressions can convey a negative message.
</p>

<h2 class="nci-heading-h2">What are some of the harms that stigma can cause?</h2>
<p class="usa-prose">
<strong>Dr. Ostroff:</strong> Research shows that stigma can contribute to people with lung cancer experiencing depression,
withdrawing from friends and family, and refusing to get any help with tobacco cessation. Stigma can also make
some people reluctant to share their diagnosis with friends and family, because they don’t want to be lectured
about smoking. This is unfortunate because if people don’t share a diagnosis of lung cancer, they may not
receive the social support that we know is so essential for all patients who are diagnosed with cancer.
</p>

<h2 class="nci-heading-h2">Are there some unexpected consequences of lung cancer stigma?</h2>
${doctorAEmbed}
<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Ostroff:</strong> As advances in lung cancer care have accelerated, we are
	now seeing an expanding group of lung cancer patient advocates. In many cases, these advocates are individuals
	who have not struggled with tobacco dependence. We think that stigma may be dividing the advocate community by
	contributing to an “othering” of people who smoke or have smoked.
</p>

<h2 class="nci-heading-h2">What led you to develop the lung cancer training for health care providers?</h2>
<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Banerjee:</strong> We know that smoking is the leading preventable cause of
	lung cancer and 13 other cancers, as well as of countless chronic medical conditions. Advocates have been urging
	us to communicate about the importance of reducing smoking in ways that show compassion, respect, and support
	for individuals struggling with nicotine or tobacco addiction. We credit advocates with bringing this research
	problem to our attention.
</p>

<h2 class="nci-heading-h2">Can you tell us about the trial?</h2>
<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Ostroff:</strong> Building on <a href="#url1" class="usa-link">our previous studies</a>,
	the training offers strategies to help health care providers communicate effectively with people who have a
	smoking history without using stigmatizing language. Sixteen sites nationwide will <a href="#url2" class="usa-link">test
	what we call the Empathic Communication Skills training in a randomized trial</a>.
</p>

<p class="usa-prose">
	The training is done virtually. Participants can practice skills in small groups with actors playing the roles
	of patients or caregivers. Trained facilitators provide tailored feedback. For health care providers, empathic
	communication involves conveying an understanding of a patient's perspective. This might mean encouraging people
	to express their feelings while also acknowledging and validating these feelings.
</p>
${doctorBEmbed}
<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Banerjee:</strong> The role-plays are reminiscent of a standard part of
	medical education called Observed Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), which is a way to evaluate a student's
	clinical skills in a simulated medical environment. We think it's important to emphasize that we're not providing
	a script for health care providers; rather, we are giving them a blueprint for engaging with patients, and it's
	up to each person to develop approaches that work for them and their patients.
</p>

<h2 class="nci-heading-h2">How will you assess the success of the trial?</h2>
<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Ostroff:</strong> We will establish the success of the trial by evaluating the
	impact of Empathic Communication Skills training on health care providers' uptake of communication and empathy
	skills. We will also examine patient responses about their perceptions of lung cancer stigma and satisfaction
	with care.
</p>

<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Banerjee:</strong> Our hypothesis is that clinicians who are trained in empathic
	communication skills will be better able to engage with patients—and ask them about their smoking history—in a way
	that increases the likelihood that patients will participate in tobacco cessation programs. Clinicians are busy.
	They need evidence-based guidance regarding best practices for taking a smoking history, and we hope our training
	can help meet that need.
</p>

<h2 class="nci-heading-h2">Is there a take-home message about communication between health care providers and people
	with lung cancer who have a history of smoking?</h2>
<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Ostroff:</strong> This trial is part of a national and even international
	movement to change the conversation around lung cancer. We know that words matter, and they matter to our
	patients. When stigma enters the medical consultation room, it can interfere with health care providers'
	ability to provide the recommended cancer care.
</p>

<p class="usa-prose">
	<strong>Dr. Banerjee:</strong> Taking a smoking history really does not need to be a
	painful medical procedure. We believe that learning certain communication skills can improve that experience
	and ultimately people's health.
