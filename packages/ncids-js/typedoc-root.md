# NCI Design System JavaScript Library
The `@nciocpl/ncids-js` package contains the JavaScript classes needed to initialize the dynamic functionality of NCIDS components. This web site contains the API documentation and information for performing advanced customizations for those JavaScript classes. While the library was created using TypeScript, you do not have to use TypeScript to use it. In fact all code examples are in plain JavaScript. If you are a TypeScript developer, the publicly exported types and interfaces has been included on this site.

## Installation
See [Getting Started for Developers](https://designsystem-dev.cancer.gov/develop/get-started/developers) for complete details on how to install the `ncids-js` package.
